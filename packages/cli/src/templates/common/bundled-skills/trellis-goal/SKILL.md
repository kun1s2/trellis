# Trellis Goal

Trellis Goal is the Codex-native goal bridge for Trellis-managed projects. Trellis prepares durable project artifacts; Codex native goal mode executes the unattended work.

The boundary is strict:

- Trellis owns `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, optional `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl`, and `task.json.meta.trellis_goal`.
- Codex owns the active native goal created with `create_goal`.
- Trellis artifacts are context and evidence checkpoints for the Codex goal, not a second execution engine.

Official native limits to preserve:

- Native goal objectives have an absolute 4000-character limit. Target 3500 characters or less for `create_goal.objective`.
- `token_budget` is optional. Passing it can make the goal end as `BudgetLimited`; omit it unless the user explicitly supplied a token budget.
- Official docs describe goals as able to work for multiple or many hours. Do not promise uninterrupted multi-day or multi-week execution.
- Active goal continuations are ignored in Plan mode. Do not start or promise unattended auto-advance while the current environment is in Plan mode.

## Entry Modes

1. **New goal request**: when the user invokes `/goal <request>` or asks Trellis to run an unattended goal, read `references/goal-contract.md`, `references/task-mapping.md`, `references/ambiguity-handling.md`, `references/trellis-goal-protocol.md`, and `references/prd-mapping.md`. Create a normal Trellis task, initialize the Goal Contract, design, and checkpoints, run `task.py mark-goal <task> --source new-request`, activate the task when the gate passes, then call Codex native `create_goal`.
2. **Planning task conversion**: when an existing planning task should become a goal, preserve useful PRD material as evidence, rewrite the goal-facing sections into the Goal Contract structure, create/update `design.md` and `implement.md`, run `task.py mark-goal <task> --source planning-task`, activate after the gate passes, then call `create_goal`.
3. **In-progress task conversion**: when an already-started task should become a goal, first perform a Conversion Audit and add a `Reconcile Existing Work` checkpoint. Then create/update `design.md` and `implement.md`, run `task.py mark-goal <task> --source in-progress-task`, and call `create_goal` without resetting task status.
4. **Continuation**: if `task.json.meta.trellis_goal.enabled` is true, or `prd.md` contains a Trellis Goal Contract, load this skill to verify whether Codex native goal is already active. Apply the Status Policy below before continuing or bridging. If no native goal is active and `create_goal` is available, bridge the Trellis task into Codex native goal. If a native goal is active, keep using Trellis artifacts as context/checkpoints while Codex goal mode owns execution.
5. **Contract-only mode**: only when the user explicitly asks to write, review, or improve goal text without running it, use `references/goal-contract.md` and do not create, mark, start, bridge, or modify a Trellis task.

## Codex Bridge Contract

After a Trellis goal initialization gate passes in Codex, successful initialization is not complete until native `create_goal` has been called.

The `create_goal` objective must be a compact bridge, not a copy of the Trellis artifacts. Native `create_goal` rejects objectives over 4000 characters, so target 3500 characters or less.

The compact objective must include:

- the active Trellis task path
- a requirement to read `task.json.meta.trellis_goal`, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, and context manifests when present
- a one-line objective summary plus current cadence / next-checkpoint hint
- an instruction that `prd.md` is the Goal Contract source, `design.md` is the technical boundary source, and `implement.md` checkpoints are evidence checkpoints rather than a separate queue
- the required verification command or evidence policy, compressed to a path or short phrase when detailed in `implement.md`
- a requirement to update Trellis artifacts with work performed, verification evidence, remaining risk, blockers, and final status
- a requirement to follow normal Trellis Phase 3.4 commit and finish/archive policy
- a requirement to use Codex native `update_goal` only when the goal is genuinely complete or blocked

Use this compact bridge shape for `create_goal.objective`:

```text
Complete the Trellis-backed goal for <task path>.
Sources to read first: task.json meta, prd.md, design.md, implement.md, and context manifests when present.
Objective: <one-line summary only; full contract is in prd.md>.
Next checkpoint: <checkpoint title/status from implement.md, or start at first pending checkpoint>.
Rules: prd.md is the Goal Contract source; design.md is the technical boundary source; implement.md checkpoints are evidence checkpoints, not a second queue.
Verify/report: follow implement.md verification policy, update Trellis artifacts with evidence/risks/blockers, follow Trellis Phase 3.4, and call update_goal only for genuine complete/blocked terminal states.
```

Do not paste the full raw request, Goal Contract, checkpoint list, project rules, or spec excerpts into the native objective when those details already live in Trellis files. If `create_goal` rejects the handoff for length, compress the objective and retry once before recording a handoff blocker.

Only pass `token_budget` to `create_goal` when the user explicitly supplied a token budget. If the user did not explicitly request a token budget, omit the `token_budget` argument entirely and do not invent, infer, or include a bounded token budget in the objective.

If the current collaboration mode is Plan mode, do not call `create_goal` and do not promise automatic continuation. Record `## Blocked Codex Native Goal Handoff` in `prd.md` or `implement.md` with Plan mode as the reason, leave task artifacts durable, and report that native continuations resume only outside Plan mode.

If `create_goal` is unavailable in the current environment, do not simulate the goal with a Trellis checkpoint loop. Record `## Blocked Codex Native Goal Handoff` in `prd.md` or `implement.md`, leave task artifacts durable, and report that the Codex-native goal could not be started.

## Status Policy

When `get_goal` is available, inspect the native goal before continuing, bridging, or marking terminal status. Normalize status names before routing because tool or UI output may vary casing or separators.

- `Active`: continue the objective and keep Trellis artifacts current.
- `Paused`: do not continue automatically; report that the native goal is paused and needs `/goal resume` or user direction.
- `BudgetLimited`: do not call `update_goal(status="blocked")` or `complete`; record/report that the explicit user-supplied goal budget was exhausted.
- `UsageLimited`: do not call `update_goal(status="blocked")`; record/report that product/account usage limits stopped progress.
- `Blocked`: do not mark complete or re-block immediately; continue only after the user resolves or resumes the blocker, then start a fresh blocked audit.
- `Complete`: do not continue or create a replacement unless the user explicitly clears/starts a new goal.

## Hard Rules

- Use ordinary Trellis task state only: `task.json`, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, optional `implement.jsonl`, optional `check.jsonl`, and `research/`.
- Do not add a new `task.json.status`, a separate goal directory, a checkpoint queue file, a runtime mailbox, or another durable source of truth.
- Do not create or continue standalone `goals/<id>` or `goal-[num]` directories from this skill.
- Do not edit business/source code during goal initialization. Initialization writes only Trellis task artifacts and context manifests.
- Preserve the raw user request verbatim in `prd.md`.
- `prd.md` is the Goal Contract source of truth; `design.md` is the technical design source of truth; `implement.md` is the checkpoint/evidence source of truth.
- Never invent or infer a token budget. User-supplied token budgets are optional and must be passed to `create_goal` only when explicit.
- Do not mark the native goal blocked or complete merely because it is paused, budget-limited, usage-limited, or the current turn is ending.
- Use `task.py mark-goal` for `task.json.meta.trellis_goal`; do not hand-edit goal metadata.
- Use `task.py goal-info` when resuming or auditing goal metadata and checkpoint progress.
- Configure `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` only when the local workflow/platform uses context manifests or extra spec/research context is needed.
- Low-risk ambiguity becomes a recorded default assumption; medium ambiguity uses `trellis-grill-agents` only to pressure-test evidence-backed assumptions; high-risk, scope-changing, or preference-dependent ambiguity becomes `BLOCKED`.
- Goal execution must not bypass Trellis Phase 3.4 commit confirmation policy.
