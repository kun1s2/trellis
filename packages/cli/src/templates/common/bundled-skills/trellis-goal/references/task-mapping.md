# Trellis Task Mapping

Trellis Goal uses the existing Trellis task lifecycle as durable context for a Codex native goal. The goal marker is routing metadata, not a second lifecycle or execution backend.

## Durable Files

| Purpose | Location |
|---|---|
| Lifecycle status | `task.json.status` (`planning`, `in_progress`, existing archive flow) |
| Goal routing marker | `task.json.meta.trellis_goal` |
| Raw request and Goal Contract | `prd.md` |
| Technical design, evidence, risks, verification commands | `design.md` |
| Native-goal checkpoints and progress evidence | `implement.md` |
| Implementation context manifest | `implement.jsonl` when the platform/workflow uses context manifests |
| Check context manifest | `check.jsonl` when the platform/workflow uses context manifests |
| Long research or grill output | `research/*.md` |

Do not create another goal directory, checkpoint queue, task status, runtime mailbox, or hidden durable state.

## Metadata Shape

Use `task.py mark-goal` to write this metadata:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "trellis_goal": {
      "enabled": true,
      "version": 1,
      "cadence": "checkpoint-bounded",
      "source": "new-request",
      "converted_from_status": "planning",
      "converted_at": "2026-05-31T12:00:00+08:00",
      "updated_at": "2026-05-31T12:00:00+08:00"
    }
  }
}
```

Allowed `cadence` values:

- `checkpoint-bounded`: the native goal should keep checkpoint evidence fresh and may stop after a bounded checkpoint when the product pauses or resumes it.
- `run-to-completion`: the native goal handoff should ask Codex to keep working until the Goal Contract is satisfied or a terminal stop condition appears.

The cadence field is a handoff/progress hint. It must not be implemented as a local loop, queue, mailbox, or standalone runner.

Allowed `source` values:

- `new-request`
- `planning-task`
- `in-progress-task`

The marker helps agents route and resume. It must not duplicate the Goal Contract, checkpoint list, native goal status, or task lifecycle.

## New Goal Request

1. Create a normal Trellis task with `task.py create`.
2. Write `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, and context manifests when needed.
3. Run:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py mark-goal <task> --source new-request --cadence checkpoint-bounded
```

Use `--cadence run-to-completion` only when the user explicitly requested run-to-completion style native goal execution.

After the initialization gate passes, call Codex native `create_goal` with a compact bridge objective that points to the Trellis task files.

## Planning Task Conversion

Use this when an existing task is still `planning`.

1. Read the current `prd.md` and task artifacts.
2. Preserve material that matters under `## Existing Planning Notes` or equivalent.
3. Rewrite the goal-facing sections into `Raw Goal Input`, `Goal Contract`, `Default Assumptions`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Out of Scope`, and `Initialization Gate Evidence`.
4. Create or update `design.md` and `implement.md` checkpoints from the contract.
5. Configure `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` only when needed for context loading.
6. Run:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py mark-goal <task> --source planning-task --cadence checkpoint-bounded
```

Do not run `task.py start` or call `create_goal` until initialization has passed.

## In-Progress Task Conversion

Use this when the task is already `in_progress`.

1. Perform a Conversion Audit before changing execution shape.
2. Record the audit in `prd.md` or `design.md`:
   - what work already exists
   - what evidence proves it
   - what remains unknown
   - whether current work matches the new Goal Contract
3. Add the first `implement.md` checkpoint as `Reconcile Existing Work`.
4. Mark existing verified work as done only when evidence is present.
5. Run:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py mark-goal <task> --source in-progress-task --cadence checkpoint-bounded
```

In-progress conversion does not reset status to `planning` and does not erase existing progress. After conversion, bridge or continue through Codex native goal state.

## Resume And Audit

Run:

```bash
python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py goal-info <task>
```

Use the output to confirm cadence, source, original status, conversion time, and checkpoint summary before choosing the next native goal handoff or continuation step.
