# Trellis Goal Protocol

Trellis Goal prepares a normal Trellis task and bridges it into Codex native goal mode. It does not replace Trellis phases, status values, commit policy, finish/archive flow, or Codex native goal state.

## Ownership Boundary

| Owner | State |
|---|---|
| Trellis | `task.json`, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, optional `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl`, and `research/` |
| Codex native goal | active unattended execution state created by `create_goal` and inspected with `get_goal` |

`implement.md` checkpoints are evidence and recovery landmarks. They help the native goal resume and report progress; they are not a local queue, mailbox, or second execution runtime.

## Initialization

1. **Inspect native goal state**
   If `get_goal` is available, call it before creating or bridging. Do not create a second native goal when one is already active.

2. **Resolve entry source**
   - new request: create a normal Trellis task
   - planning conversion: use the current planning task and preserve useful PRD material
   - in-progress conversion: audit existing work and add a `Reconcile Existing Work` checkpoint

3. **Write the Goal Contract**
   Preserve the raw request in `prd.md`, then write `Goal Contract`, `Default Assumptions`, `Acceptance Criteria`, `Out of Scope`, and `Initialization Gate Evidence`.

4. **Write the technical boundary**
   Use `design.md` for project detection, relevant files, architecture decisions, verification commands, risks, and rollback notes.

5. **Write checkpoint evidence plan**
   Use `implement.md`. Each checkpoint should have:
   - type: work or check
   - status: pending / in_progress / blocked / done
   - acceptance or verification evidence required
   - work performed, remaining risk, and next step fields

   Checkpoints should be small enough that a resumed native goal can tell what evidence is missing. They do not impose a local per-turn execution cadence.

6. **Configure context**
   Add relevant specs and research files to `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` only when the local workflow/platform uses context manifests. For inline Codex work, recording the same context plan in `prd.md` or `design.md` is acceptable.

7. **Handle ambiguity**
   Apply `ambiguity-handling.md`:
   - low risk: record a default assumption and continue
   - medium: use `trellis-grill-agents` only for evidence-backed pressure testing
   - high risk: record the blocker and do not call `create_goal`

8. **Mark the task**
   Run `task.py mark-goal` with the correct `--source` and cadence hint. Do not hand-edit `task.json`.

9. **Gate and activate**
   If initialization passes, start the Trellis task when needed, then call Codex native `create_goal` with a compact bridge objective. If initialization fails, record `## Blocked Initialization` or `## Blocked Codex Native Goal Handoff` and do not simulate goal execution locally.

## Native Handoff

The `create_goal.objective` text is a compact pointer to Trellis artifacts. It should include:

- active task path
- files to read first
- one-line objective summary
- next checkpoint hint
- verification/reporting policy
- instruction to update Trellis artifacts with evidence, blockers, risks, and final status
- instruction to use `update_goal` only for genuine complete or blocked terminal states

Do not paste the full raw request, full Goal Contract, checkpoint list, project rules, or spec excerpts into the native objective when those details already live in Trellis files.

## Continuation

At the start of every continuation:

1. Use `get_goal` when available and apply the native status policy.
2. Run or mentally reproduce `task.py goal-info <task>`.
3. Read `task.json`, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, and context manifests when present.
4. Continue the active native goal objective.
5. Update `implement.md` with work performed, verification evidence, remaining risk, and next checkpoint.

Evidence can be diff review, command output, logs, tests, typecheck, build, UI inspection, file review, or another concrete artifact suited to the checkpoint. Do not mark a checkpoint done from confidence alone.

## Native Status Policy

- `Active`: continue the objective and keep Trellis artifacts current.
- `Paused`: do not continue automatically; report that the native goal is paused.
- `BudgetLimited`: report the exhausted user-supplied budget; do not mark blocked or complete.
- `UsageLimited`: report the product/account limit; do not mark blocked.
- `Blocked`: continue only after the blocker is resolved or the user resumes the goal.
- `Complete`: do not continue or create a replacement unless the user explicitly starts a new goal.

## Blocking

Record the blocker in Trellis artifacts before stopping. Use `update_goal(status="blocked")` only when the same blocking condition has repeated for the required Codex blocked threshold, or when a Goal Contract `Stop If` condition makes further work unsafe.

Do not use blocked merely because the work is hard, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.

## Finalization

When the Goal Contract is satisfied:

1. Verify every `Done When` item with evidence.
2. Confirm no `Stop If` condition is active.
3. Run required tests, lint, typecheck, build, screenshots, or static checks.
4. Update `implement.md` and task artifacts with final evidence and remaining risks.
5. Follow Trellis Phase 3.4 commit confirmation and finish/archive policy.
6. Call `update_goal(status="complete")` only when no required work remains.

If commit confirmation or archive policy requires user confirmation, record the pending plan and stop there; do not claim full completion until the normal Trellis finish path is complete.
